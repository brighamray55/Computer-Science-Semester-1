'''UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM: The user inputs data into a function which
calculates how much money a return trip will cost based on the size of their
gas tank, the cost of gas per gallon, how many miles per gallon they will be
able to go on one tank, and the number of miles per given trip. The money
will be in usd and the formula used will be miles per gallon. The car doesn't
experience issues on the way back. The car will be driving at 60mpg and mpg
is Calculated when the car is 60mph highway. The gas will be exactly a
certain dollar value'''

'''PLAN A SOLUTION: Our first parameter will be the length of the return trip.
This will allow the program to start on the highest level of user input. The
next parameters are size of the tank, cost of gas, how many miles they can go
in one tank.'''
# This first thing we need to do is define the function.
'''

def trip(miles_traveled, size_of_tank, miles_per_tank, cost_of_gas):
# then calculate mpg
# since the user input is a string we have to change the size of tank and miles
# per tank variables to integers for calculation.
    size_of_tank = int(size_of_tank)
    miles_per_tank = int(miles_per_tank)
    miles_traveled = int(miles_traveled)
    cost_of_gas = int(cost_of_gas)
    mpg = miles_per_tank / size_of_tank
# Calculate the number of gallons that it requires to go the entire length of
# the trip
    num_of_gallons = miles_traveled / mpg
# since we have the numer of gallons needed we can now calculate the cost of
# the trip.
    print("$ " + str(num_of_gallons * cost_of_gas))
# end of the sexy little function
# Now we want to display the results of the function

'''
IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING: There were no issues running the program. The
code runs according to plan. There were no issues in how the code operated.
'''
'''
REFLECTION: The problem solving process has continued to make running and
testing the code a dream. Coming up with a plan to test the solution allowed
the code to run perfectly the very first time without any ridiculous and
annoying repetition. At first there was no $ sign at the beginning to specify
how much MONEY the trip cost and so instead of just print(num_of_gallons
* cost_of_gas) a dollar sign was added to specify the exact amount of money it
actually did cost.
